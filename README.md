# AsepriteSheetPacker
 Packs multiple aseprite files into a single sprite sheet. 
 This was made with Godot as a tool to help my personal game dev projects

 Feel free to 
 - Use this however you like in any sort of project.
 - Fork it and improve it on your own or contribute to this one :D

Download latest version from releases on the right.
Unpack the zip and you are good to go!
 
The usage is pretty self explanatory from the UI.

Find the Aseprite.exe file
Find all your .aseprite files
Order them in the order you want them to appear in the sprite sheet
Set the output directory
Set the output file name
Then generate
